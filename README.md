# Protein Prediction Model
By: Kevin Zhang

## Introduction

### General Introduction
As a frequent-ish gym goer I always wondered how much protein was in my food. It's very tedious and hard to do without a scale and sometimes really inconvenient making me leave gains on the table. In this project, the primary goal is to predict how much protein is in a recipe to really help maximize 

To do this I will:
1. Merge and Clean the DataSets
2. Conduct Exploratory Analysis
3. Frame a Prediction Problem
4. Create a Base model
5. Improve Upon the Base Model for my Final Model
